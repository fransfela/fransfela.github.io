Excited to share that our team won the **Microsoft Power Platform Hackathon** hosted by GN Store Nord and Microsoft!

#### Event Details

**Date:** April 24-25, 2024  
**Location:** Microsoft Office, Kgs. Lyngby, Copenhagen, Denmark  
**Organizers:** GN Store Nord & Microsoft

#### Our Solution

Together with my colleague **Nuno**, we developed a prototype to:

- **Automate request backlog management** across departments
- **Real-time status updates** for ongoing projects
- **Automatic reporting** with cross-departmental visibility
- **Streamline internal workflows** using Power Platform tools

#### Impact

The solution addresses a critical need at GN: reducing manual overhead in tracking requests and enabling teams to focus on high-value work. By leveraging Power Automate and Power BI, we created a scalable system that can be deployed across multiple departments.

This hackathon was a fantastic opportunity to combine technical innovation with practical business needs, and a reminder that the best solutions often come from understanding real-world pain points.

Thanks to the organizing team and congratulations to all participants!
