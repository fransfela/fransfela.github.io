<p>Singing or speaking while using a headset or hearing aid can present significant challenges due to the occlusion effect, alongside variances in processing latency and auditory distortions inherent to these devices. Such challenges are particularly pronounced in activities like singing, where precise control over one's vocal quality is paramount for performance. This study investigates the factors detrimental to the perceptual quality of one's own voice when using in-ear headsets and how each factor influences one's perception of self-voice. Prior literature reviews lead to occlusion, sidetone filters, latency, and distortion as the main factors. Twenty-three assessors participated in a subjective evaluation, which was followed by statistical data analysis. Further investigation was carried out through an assessor screening procedure and text analysis was performed on responses to collected open-ended questions. The study found that occlusion and distortion are the influential factors for the changes in self-voice perception, whereas latency is a determinant. Sidetone filtering becomes a significant factor when occlusion effects are minimized.</p>
