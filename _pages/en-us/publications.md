description: My research journey started in Acoustics with my bachelor's thesis on Mathematical Modeling of Acoustic Emission for Water Pipeline Leakage Detection, while simultaneously working as a research assistant specializing in building acoustics and physics. This foundation evolved during my master's studies at Institut Teknologi Bandung, where I delved into audio-visual perception, VR technology, and immersive multimedia. Today, my research centers on perceptual multimedia evaluation for next-generation AV communication devices, integrating expertise in experimental design optimization, predictive modeling, statistical machine learning, perceptual metrics, and composite model building. Here are selected highlights from my scientific contributions.
