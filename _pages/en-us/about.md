I spend my days asking: *"How do devices and algorithms really sound and look to humans?"* — then building systems to answer that question at scale.

My work at [Jabra](https://www.jabra.com/) sits at the intersection of:
- 🎧 Audio-visual quality evaluation
- 🤖 Bridging AI metrics with human perception  
- 📊 Turning subjective ratings into actionable insights

Beyond the lab, I supervise Master's students at Danish universities (DTU, Aalborg) — and I'm open to collaborating with students from universities abroad. I also run a mentoring practice through [MentoringBangRandy](/mentoring/), helping aspiring Indonesian researchers crack the master's and PhD application code, share career reflections on YouTube, and try to balance being a present parent with staying on top of the latest AI hype cycles.

**What drives me:** Making technology more human-centered, one metric at a time.

**Quick facts:**
- PhD in [Perceptual Evaluation of Immersive Audio-visual Technology](https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/perceptual-evaluation-of-immersive-audiovisual-quality) from [Technical University of Denmark](https://electro.dtu.dk/) (because someone has to quantify "good enough")
- Built internal tools that evaluate 100+ audio-visual metrics (yes, I did!)
- Supervise Master's theses on perceptual evaluation, AI, signal processing, and human-centered tech
- Survived the Danish winter (multiple times)
- I love exploring the flavor of coffee ☕ using different manual brewing techniques
