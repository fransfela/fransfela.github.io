</div>

The application follows a straightforward workflow:

1. **Upload Data**: Import a CSV file containing recipient information
2. **Compose Email**: Use the rich text editor to craft your message

### Example Personalization

You can use placeholders to personalize both the subject and body of your emails:

```
