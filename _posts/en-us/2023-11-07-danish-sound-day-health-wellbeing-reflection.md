Yesterday, I found myself sitting in the auditorium at **Copenhagen Hearing & Balance Center (CHBC), Rigshospitalet**, surrounded by researchers, clinicians, audio engineers, and startup founders, all gathered for [**Danish Sound Day 2023**](https://danishsoundcluster.dk/danish-sound-day-2023/). The theme? *Sound and audio technologies and its connection to health and well-being.*

But as presentations unfolded, on hearing aids, schizophrenia treatment, sleep optimization, and deep vibrations, my mind kept drifting back to a humid night in 2016, somewhere in a sprawling Indonesian hospital.

## A Night in the ICU: My First Encounter with Healthcare Soundscapes

During my master's studies, I worked on a project that feels oddly prophetic now: **auditory and audio-visual reproduction environments for 3D ambisonics recording to train novice nurses**. The idea was to capture realistic ICU soundscapes that could be used in immersive training simulations, so nursing students could experience the sensory overload of critical care environments before their first real shift.

But here's the thing: **capturing a true ICU soundscape is not straightforward**.

My classmates and I needed high-fidelity, spatially accurate recordings. So we did what any slightly desperate master's students would do: **we spent a night in the ICU of one of Indonesia's largest hospitals**, armed with ambisonics microphones, sound level meters, and a mission to document the acoustic chaos of critical care.

We recorded everything:
- The relentless beeping of ventilators and monitors
- Footsteps echoing down sterile corridors
- Muffled conversations between doctors and families
- The hum of HVAC systems struggling against tropical heat

We even measured the **sound directivity of medical equipment**, because understanding where sound is coming from matters when you're trying to reproduce spatial realism in a training simulator.

Why did we have to be so creative (read: guerrilla)? **Administrative and procedural limitations**. Getting formal approval for research in a live ICU is a bureaucratic nightmare, especially in a developing country where research ethics boards are understaffed and protocols are ambiguous. So we worked within the constraints, improvised, and got it done.

Looking back, that experience taught me something fundamental: **Sound in healthcare is often overlooked until it becomes a problem**. And by then, it's usually too late.

## Fast Forward: Danish Sound Day and the Evolution of Audio in Health

Yesterday's event at Rigshospitalet felt like the intellectual evolution of what we were fumbling toward back in Indonesia. Except now, the research is **systematic, well-funded, and clinically validated**.

Here's what stood out:

### 1. **Sound and Schizophrenia Treatment** (Katalin Vikuk & Anders Bargum)

One of the most striking sessions explored how **auditory hallucinations** are being treated through sound-based interventions. The idea: use carefully designed soundscapes to help patients regain control over intrusive auditory experiences.

This resonates with a broader question I've been thinking about: **Can we "design away" perceptual distress?** In my ICU recording project, we were trying to prepare nurses for sensory overload. But what if we could also design hospital soundscapes that actively reduce anxiety and cognitive load for both patients and staff?

The challenge? **Sound is deeply personal**. What calms one person might agitate another. AI-driven personalization could help, but we're not there yet.

### 2. **Sound and Sleep** (Kira Vibe Jespersen)

Kira's presentation on how sound affects sleep quality hit close to home. Hospital environments are notoriously bad for sleep, constant alarms, footsteps, conversations. Yet sleep is **critical for recovery**.

This made me think: **What if we applied active noise control (ANC) not just to headphones, but to hospital rooms?** Imagine a system that detects disruptive sounds and generates counteracting signals in real-time. It's technically feasible, but logistically complex. Who manages it? How do you balance noise reduction with critical alarms that need to be heard?

Still, the fact that we're even having these conversations signals progress.

### 3. **The Future of Hearing Aids and Audio Use** (Panel with Alex Costa & Nick Hunn)

The panel on hearing aids was eye-opening. We're moving from **assistive devices to augmented hearing systems**, where the line between "correcting hearing loss" and "enhancing normal hearing" is blurring.

This ties back to a theme from my PhD: **How do we evaluate what "good" sounds like?** If hearing aids can now apply AI-driven sound enhancements, who decides what the "correct" sound should be? The audiologist? The user? The algorithm?

This is where perceptual evaluation becomes critical. We need **standardized, cross-cultural frameworks** for assessing subjective audio quality in health-related applications. Otherwise, we risk building systems that optimize for metrics (like speech intelligibility) but ignore user satisfaction.

## What I Learned: The Gap Between Research and Implementation

Here's the uncomfortable truth: **Most of the research presented yesterday will take years, if not decades, to reach patients**.

Why?

1. **Regulatory Barriers**: Medical devices face stringent approval processes. A novel soundscape intervention for sleep might work in a lab, but proving efficacy in a hospital setting requires large-scale clinical trials, funding, and time.

2. **Cost Sensitivity**: Hospitals operate on tight budgets. A high-tech sound system for ICU rooms? Probably not a priority when they're struggling to afford basic equipment.

3. **Cultural Resistance**: Healthcare is conservative (for good reason). Convincing clinicians to adopt new sound-based interventions requires overwhelming evidence, and even then, adoption is slow.

But here's what gives me hope: **The Danish ecosystem is uniquely positioned to bridge this gap**. With close collaboration between research institutions (like CHBC), industry leaders (GN, EPOS, Cochlear), and government support through Danish Sound Cluster, Denmark has a shot at turning research into real-world impact faster than most countries.

## My Takeaway: Sound in Healthcare Needs Perceptual Validation

If there's one thing I want people to take away from this, it's this: **Sound in healthcare is not just about objective metrics**.

You can measure sound pressure levels, frequency spectra, and reverberation times all day. But unless you validate how humans actually perceive and respond to those sounds, you're designing in the dark.

This is why my work in **perceptual evaluation** feels more relevant than ever. The future of healthcare audio isn't just about building better speakers or quieter ventilators. It's about understanding:
- How does a patient with dementia perceive hospital soundscapes differently from a young adult?
- What sound cues help nurses navigate critical decisions under stress?
- How do we balance the need for auditory privacy with the need for medical monitoring?

These are perceptual questions, not just engineering ones. And they require interdisciplinary collaboration between acousticians, psychologists, clinicians, and AI developers.

## Final Thought: From Guerrilla Recordings to Global Standards

Sitting in that Rigshospitalet auditorium, I couldn't help but smile at the contrast. A decade ago, I was sneaking microphones into an Indonesian ICU, hoping security wouldn't kick us out. Yesterday, I was listening to world-class researchers present meticulously designed studies on the same topic, backed by millions in funding and institutional support.

But both efforts share a common belief: **Sound matters in healthcare**. It shapes patient outcomes, staff performance, and the overall healing environment. The difference now is that we have the tools, the data, and the institutional will to do something about it.

The question is: **Will we?**
