In December, we launched our first natively multimodal model Gemini 1.0 in three sizes: Ultra, Pro and Nano. Just a few months later we released 1.5 Pro, with enhanced performance and a breakthrough long context window of 1 million tokens.Developers and enterprise customers have been putting 1.5 Pro to use in incredible ways and finding its long context window, multimodal reasoning capabilities and impressive overall performance incredibly useful.We know from user feedback that some applications need lower latency and a lower cost to serve. This inspired us to keep innovating, so today, we’re introducing Gemini 1.5 Flash: a model that’s lighter-weight than 1.5 Pro, and designed to be fast and efficient to serve at scale.Both 1.5 Pro and 1.5 Flash are available in public preview with a 1 million token context window in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI. And now, 1.5 Pro is also available with a 2 million token context window via waitlist to developers using the API and to Google Cloud customers.We’re also introducing updates across the Gemini family of models, announcing our next generation of open models, Gemma 2, and sharing progress on the future of AI assistants, with Project Astra.Context lengths of leading foundation models compared with Gemini 1.5’s 2 million token capability1.5 Flash is the newest addition to the Gemini model family and the fastest Gemini model served in the API. It’s optimized for high-volume, high-frequency tasks at scale, is more cost-efficient to serve and features our breakthrough long context window.While it’s a lighter weight model than 1.5 Pro, it’s highly capable of multimodal reasoning across vast amounts of information and delivers impressive quality for its size.The new Gemini 1.5 Flash model is optimized for speed and efficiency, is highly capable of multimodal reasoning and features our breakthrough long context window.1.5 Flash excels at summarization, chat applications, image and video captioning, data extraction from long documents and tables, and more. This is because it’s been trained by 1.5 Pro through a process called “distillation,” where the most essential knowledge and skills from a larger model are transferred to a smaller, more efficient model.Read more about 1.5 Flash in our updated Gemini 1.5 technical report, on the Gemini technology page, and learn about 1.5 Flash’s availability and pricing.Over the last few months, we’ve significantly improved 1.5 Pro, our best model for general performance across a wide range of tasks.Beyond extending its context window to 2 million tokens, we’ve enhanced its code generation, logical reasoning and planning, multi-turn conversation, and audio and image understanding through data and algorithmic advances. We see strong improvements on public and internal benchmarks for each of these tasks.1.5 Pro can now follow increasingly complex and nuanced instructions, including ones that specify product-level behavior involving role, format and style. We’ve improved control over the model’s responses for specific use cases, like crafting the persona and response style of a chat agent or automating workflows through multiple function calls. And we’ve enabled users to steer model behavior by setting system instructions.We added audio understanding in the Gemini API and Google AI Studio, so 1.5 Pro can now reason across image and audio for videos uploaded in Google AI Studio. And we’re now integrating 1.5 Pro into Google products, including Gemini Advanced and in Workspace apps.Read more about 1.5 Pro in our updated Gemini 1.5 technical report and on the Gemini technology page.Gemini Nano is expanding beyond text-only inputs to include images as well. Starting with Pixel, applications using Gemini Nano with Multimodality will be able to understand the world the way people do — not just through text, but also through sight, sound and spoken language.Read more about Gemini 1.0 Nano on Android.Today, we’re also sharing a series of updates to Gemma, our family of open models built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models.We’re announcing Gemma 2, our next generation of open models for responsible AI innovation. Gemma 2 has a new architecture designed for breakthrough performance and efficiency, and will be available in new sizes.The Gemma family is also expanding with PaliGemma, our first vision-language model inspired by PaLI-3. And we’ve upgraded our Responsible Generative AI Toolkit with LLM Comparator for evaluating the quality of model responses.Read more on the Developer blog.As part of Google DeepMind’s mission to build AI responsibly to benefit humanity, we’ve always wanted to develop universal AI agents that can be helpful in everyday life. That’s why today, we’re sharing our progress in building the future of AI assistants with Project Astra (advanced seeing and talking responsive agent).To be truly useful, an agent needs to understand and respond to the complex and dynamic world just like people do — and take in and remember what it sees and hears to understand context and take action. It also needs to be proactive, teachable and personal, so users can talk to it naturally and without lag or delay.While we’ve made incredible progress developing AI systems that can understand multimodal information, getting response time down to something conversational is a difficult engineering challenge. Over the past few years, we’ve been working to improve how our models perceive, reason and converse to make the pace and quality of interaction feel more natural.Building on Gemini, we’ve developed prototype agents that can process information faster by continuously encoding video frames, combining the video and speech input into a timeline of events, and caching this information for efficient recall.By leveraging our leading speech models, we also enhanced how they sound, giving the agents a wider range of intonations. These agents can better understand the context they’re being used in, and respond quickly, in conversation.With technology like this, it’s easy to envision a future where people could have an expert AI assistant by their side, through a phone or glasses. And some of these capabilities are coming to Google products, like the Gemini app and web experience, later this year.We’ve made incredible progress so far with our family of Gemini models, and we’re always striving to advance the state-of-the-art even further. By investing in a relentless production line of innovation, we’re able to explore new ideas at the frontier, while also unlocking the possibility of new and exciting Gemini use cases.Learn more about Gemini and its capabilities.

Imagine you’re on a quest to bake the perfect batch of cookies. You have various ingredients, each with multiple options. DoE is your trusty recipe book, helping you systematically test different combinations to discover the ideal recipe.</p> <p>In this blog, we’ll dive into the core principles of experimental design and explore how they apply to the world of perceptual audio evaluation. We’ll keep it simple and straightforward.</p> <p>Think of experimental design as the roadmap that guides researchers in conducting experiments to assess audio quality. It helps ensure that the results are meaningful, free from bias, and applicable to real-world situations.</p> <h3>Principles of Experimental Design</h3> <p>Let’s delve into the essential principles of experimental design and see how they play out in perceptual audio evaluation:</p> <p><strong>1. Clear Objectives<br/></strong>Before starting an experiment, you need to know exactly what you want to find out. Every experiment should begin with a clear understanding of what you want to achieve. What’s the research question or hypothesis you’re testing? Without a well-defined objective, your experiment lacks direction.</p> <p>Every audio evaluation must begin with a clear objective. Your objective might be to determine whether a new audio processing algorithm improves sound quality compared to an existing one, assessing the sound quality of a new audio codec or fine-tuning the spatial characteristics of a speaker system.</p> <p><strong>2. Randomization<br/></strong>Randomly assigning participants or test conditions helps prevent bias and ensures that your results are representative.</p> <p>Randomization ensures that listeners’ experiences are not influenced by the order in which they hear audio samples. It’s like shuffling a playlist to prevent any bias from creeping into the evaluation.</p> <p><strong>3. Control Group<br/></strong>Having a control group provides a baseline for comparison. It helps you gauge the impact of the treatment or change you’re testing.</p> <p>You might have a control group of listeners who hear the audio without any enhancements, while another group assesses the enhanced audio. This allows you to measure the improvement. Also, in audio evaluation, a control group often serves as the benchmark for comparison. It’s a reference point against which the quality of other audio samples is measured. For instance, when testing the effectiveness of noise reduction algorithms, the control group represents the unprocessed sound.</p> <p><strong>4. Replication<br/></strong>Repetition is the key to consistency. Repeating your experiments multiple times and obtaining consistent results increases your confidence in the findings. If different groups of listeners consistently rate the enhanced audio as better than the unenhanced audio, it strengthens the conclusion that the enhancement is effective.</p> <p><strong>5. Blocking<br/></strong>In some experiments, external factors called confounding variables, such as ambient noise, listener fatigue, or even the audio playback equipment, can influence the results. Blocking involves grouping subjects or samples with similar characteristics, helping control these variables’ impact.</p> <p><strong>6. Blinding<br/></strong>Keeping certain information hidden from participants or experimenters minimizes bias. In a double-blind test, neither the listeners nor the experimenters know which audio sample is which, reducing the chance of biased ratings.</p> <p><strong>7. Sample Size Determination<br/></strong>Determining the right number of listeners or samples is crucial for the statistical power of the evaluation. A small sample may not capture nuances, while an overly large one can be overwhelming and costly.</p> <p><strong>8. Data Collection and Analysis Plan<br/></strong>Before starting your experiment, outline how you’ll collect and analyze data. Having a pre-defined plan ensures objectivity and reduces the temptation to cherry-pick results.</p> <h3>Real-World Application in Perceptual Audio Evaluation</h3> <p>These principles aren’t just theoretical. In perceptual audio evaluation, they help researchers design experiments that assess the quality of audio processing algorithms, audio codecs, or audio equipment. By following these principles, researchers ensure that their findings are robust and meaningful. Following are a few examples:</p> <p><strong>Audio Codecs</strong>: Evaluating the quality of audio codecs to ensure crystal-clear sound transmission.</p> <p><strong>Speaker Tuning</strong>: Fine-tuning the spatial characteristics of speakers to create immersive audio experiences.</p> <p><strong>Noise Reduction Algorithms</strong>: Assessing the effectiveness of algorithms in reducing unwanted noise in audio recordings.</p> <p><strong>Voice Recognition Systems</strong>: Testing the accuracy and quality of voice recognition systems for seamless communication.</p> <h3><strong>Important Notes</strong></h3> <p>Simplicity and Clarity in Experimental Design<br/>Experimental design doesn’t have to be complex or filled with jargon. In perceptual audio evaluation, these fundamental principles are the building blocks for conducting reliable experiments and drawing conclusions about audio quality. By keeping things simple and clear, researchers can make confident strides in improving audio experiences for all of us.</p> <p><strong><em>Remember: The power of experimental design lies in its simplicity and its ability to provide meaningful insights.</em></strong></p> <p><strong>References:</strong></p> <p>Kirk, R.

Frustrating, isn’t it? Well, fear not, for there’s a versatile and powerful tool that can help you conquer such multimedia challenges: FFmpeg. In this blog, I’ll take you on a journey through the wonderful world of FFmpeg, explaining what it is, what it’s used for, how it differs from other similar software, and even how to harness its magic.</p> <h3><strong>What Is FFmpeg?</strong></h3> <p>At its core, FFmpeg is like the wizard of multimedia processing. It’s an open-source software suite that handles a mind-boggling array of multimedia tasks. FFmpeg is a command-line tool, which means you interact with it by typing commands into a terminal or command prompt.</p> <p>But don’t let the command-line aspect scare you away. Once you get the hang of it, FFmpeg becomes your go-to companion for anything related to audio and video manipulation.

Choose the one that suits your needs. If you’re not sure, the “Latest Git” version is usually a safe bet.</li><li>Download the ZIP file corresponding to your system architecture (32-bit or 64-bit). If you’re unsure, go with the 64-bit version for better performance.</li></ul> <h4>Step 2: Extracting FFmpeg</h4> <ul><li>Once the download is complete, navigate to the location where you saved the ZIP file.</li><li>Right-click on the ZIP file and select “Extract All…” to unzip the contents.</li><li>Choose a destination folder for the extracted files and click “Extract.”</li></ul> <h4>Step 3: Adding FFmpeg to PATH</h4> <ul><li>Now that FFmpeg is extracted, you need to add it to your system’s PATH so that you can use it from the command line.</li><li>Search for “Environment Variables” in the Windows search bar and click “Edit the system environment variables.”</li><li>In the “System Properties” window, click the “Environment Variables…” button at the bottom.</li><li>In the “System Variables” section, find and select “Path,” then click Edit.”</li><li>Click “New” and add the path to the “bin” folder of the extracted FFmpeg files (e.g., C:\path\to\ffmpeg\bin). Click “OK” to save the changes.</li><li>Click “OK” to close all the windows.</li></ul> <h4>Step 4: Verifying the Installation</h4> <ul><li>Open the command prompt (you can search for “cmd” in the Windows search bar).</li><li>Type ffmpeg -version and press Enter. You should see information about your FFmpeg installation, confirming that it’s successfully installed.</li></ul> <h3>Installing FFmpeg on Mac</h3> <h4>Step 1: Using Homebrew (Recommended)</h4> <ul><li>Open the Terminal app. You can find it in the “Utilities” folder within the “Applications” folder.</li><li>If you don’t have Homebrew installed, you can install it by running the following command:</li></ul> <pre>/bin/bash -c &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)&quot;<br />brew install ffmpeg</pre> <ul><li>Once Homebrew is installed, you can easily install FFmpeg by running the following command:</li></ul> <h4>Step 2: Verifying the Installation</h4> <ul><li>After the installation is complete, you can verify it by running:</li></ul> <pre>ffmpeg -version</pre> <ul><li>You should see information about your FFmpeg installation, indicating that it’s ready to use.</li></ul> <h3>Ready to explore!</h3> <p>Congratulations! You’ve successfully installed FFmpeg on both your Windows and Mac machines. Now you’re armed with a versatile multimedia tool that can handle a wide range of audio and video tasks. Whether you’re editing videos, converting audio formats, or exploring the world of multimedia, FFmpeg has got your back.</p> <p>In the next blog post, we will start exploring the world of multimedia manipulation. But don’t only wait for me! Go ahead yourself, find other references, and start experimenting!</p> <p><em>Note (or actually my wise advice): Make sure to respect copyright laws and terms of use when working with multimedia files.</em></p> <p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=fb589318d117" width="1" height="1" alt=""/></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="external-posts"/><category term="medium"/></entry><entry><title type="html">a post with table of contents on a sidebar</title><link href="https://fransfela.github.io/id-id/blog/2023/sidebar-table-of-contents/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="a post with table of contents on a sidebar"/><published>2023-04-25T14:14:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-04-25T14:14:00+00:00</updated><id>https://fransfela.github.io/blog/2023/sidebar-table-of-contents</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://fransfela.github.io/blog/2023/sidebar-table-of-contents/"><![CDATA[<p>This post shows how to add a table of contents as a sidebar.</p> <h2 id="adding-a-table-of-contents">Adding a Table of Contents</h2> <p>To add a table of contents to a post as a sidebar, simply add</p> <div class="language-yml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">toc</span><span class="pi">:</span>

You just need to surround your math expression with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$$</code>, like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$$ E = mc^2 $$</code>. If you leave it inside a paragraph, it will produce an inline expression, just like \(E = mc^2\).</p> <p>In fact, you can also use a single dollar sign <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$</code> to create inline formulas, such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$ E = mc^2 $</code>, which will render as $ E = mc^2 $. This approach provides the same effect during TeX-based compilation, but visually it appears slightly less bold compared to double-dollar signs <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$$</code>, making it blend more naturally with surrounding text.</p> <p>To use display mode, again surround your expression with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$$</code> and place it as a separate paragraph. Here is an example:</p> \[\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)\] <p>Note that MathJax 3 is <a href="https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/upgrading/whats-new-3.0.html">a major re-write of MathJax</a> that brought a significant improvement to the loading and rendering speed, which is now <a href="http://www.intmath.com/cg5/katex-mathjax-comparison.php">on par with KaTeX</a>.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="citations">Citations</h2> <p>Citations are then used in the article body with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;d-cite&gt;</code> tag. The key attribute is a reference to the id provided in the bibliography. The key attribute can take multiple ids, separated by commas.</p> <p>The citation is presented inline like this: <d-cite key="gregor2015draw"></d-cite> (a number that displays more information on hover). If you have an appendix, a bibliography is automatically created and populated in it.</p> <p>Distill chose a numerical inline citation style to improve readability of citation dense articles and because many of the benefits of longer citations are obviated by displaying more information on hover. However, we consider it good style to mention author last names if you discuss something at length and it fits into the flow well — the authors are human and it’s nice for them to have the community associate them with their work.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h2> <p>Just wrap the text you would like to show up in a footnote in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;d-footnote&gt;</code> tag. The number of the footnote will be automatically generated.<d-footnote>This will become a hoverable footnote.</d-footnote></p> <hr/> <h2 id="code-blocks">Code Blocks</h2> <p>Syntax highlighting is provided within <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;d-code&gt;</code> tags. An example of inline code snippets: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;d-code language="html"&gt;let x = 10;&lt;/d-code&gt;</code>. For larger blocks of code, add a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">block</code> attribute:</p> <d-code block="" language="javascript"> var x = 25; function(x) { return x * x; } </d-code> <p><strong>Note:</strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;d-code&gt;</code> blocks do not look good in the dark mode. You can instead use the standard Jekyll syntax highlight with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">highlight</code> liquid tag.</p> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">25</span><span class="p">;</span>
